<p>School project accomplished during a course on deep networks. The goal was to see how different
architectures and hyperparameters performed on a classification problem using a subset of the
Food-101 dataset. We used Pytorch in order to perform CUDA-accelerated learning and to import a
ResNet (Residual network) and VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network) for fine-tuned training by
replacing the classification layer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Created validation pipeline to test different set of hyperparameters.</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a> with CUDA to accelerate learning on models.</li>
<li>Leveraged already available models trained on ImageNet for transfer learning for
~66% validation accuracy on a subset of the Food-101 dataset.</li>

<h5>Notable things about this project:</h5>
<dl>
  <dt>Web Components:</dt>
  <dd>
    I ended up extending the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element to create each
    project. This really helped when I was creating and adding projects to this
    website since it helped to keep everything relatively modular while allowing
    me some customizability.
  </dd>
  <dt>Dialog polyfill</dt>
  <dd>
    While creating this website, I learned that the dialog element I was taking
    advantage of was just recently added to Firefox 98. In order to support older
    versions of Firefox browsers, I decided to implement
    <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill">

        <article class="detailed-desc">
            <p>As someone who participates in a lot of forum roleplaying communities, it can be
a pain to track and manage a character's inventory. If characters are trading
amongst themselves, it can also be a pain for people who try and track which
character which items as well. I ended up creating this project as a sort of
experiment to see how I would try and solve this problem. Although it never saw
use because the community decided that requiring its use would make things
unnecessarily difficult for casual members, it still exists as a proof-of-concept.</p>

        <h4>Roleplay Roller Scraper</h4>
        <article class="detailed-desc">
            <p>Some asynchronous roleplay communities use traditional tabletop RPG mechanics
that would require the use of dice for some randomness. One community that I was
a part of had a website dedicated to these rolls, but the owner of the website
eventually became inactive and drifted away from the community. In order to
preserve these rolls, which were necessary for some recordkeeping, I made a web
scraper to save them into a CSV file using NodeJS to make and parse requests and
Node-API to link a csv builder to find out the next point.</p>
<h5>Notable things about this project:</h5>
<dl>
    <dt>Project structure management and git submodules</dt>
    <dd>
        This project taught me a lot about different ways to handle submodule
        directories. Eventually, I ended up doing a hybrid model where I had library
        code in the root directory in their own folders and a distributed directory
        structure for bespoken code due to the simplicity of the project.
    </dd>
    <dt>Creating Node.js Native Addons with Node-API/N-API</dt>
    <dd>
        The project originally was just going to be a wrapper for a CSV parser that
        would end up looking for the missing IDs within a list of files. However, I
        ended up deciding to create it into a full fledged web crawler. As such, I
        needed to port my already-written C code to NodeJS. Although it took a while
        to learn, I learned how to create native Node.js addons using Node-API.
    </dd>
    <dt>Makefiles, implicit variables and rules, and automatic dependency generation</dt>
    <dd>
        While creating the Makefile, the first thing I learned was implicit variables
        and rules where Makefiles can imply dependencies based off of the target
        (such as main.c creating main.o) and compilation rules. These include
        implicit variables and tags that could be set to use these implicit rules.
        However, since I used a distributed directory structure, I had to write my
        own rules to compile to different directories. This led to me researching
        automatic dependency generation through some C preprocessor flags ultimately
        simplifying the Makefile structure instead of explicitly writing every
        dependency.
    </dd>
    <dt>Linking C object files and libraries</dt>
    <dd>
        While a minor part of the project, I learned how to link shared dynamic
        libraries and static libraries even in different directories.
    </dd>
    <dt>Making ANSI- and ISO C89/C90-compliant C code</dt>
    <dd>
        While I do end up using GNULib's argp library to create a main executable
        (mainly for testing), all other code is ANSI compliant. While writing this,
        I actually had the chance to learn the reasons for certain specifications of
        the C89/C90 standards and how to accomodate the strict standards.

        <h4>Scalable Database</h4>
        <article class="detailed-desc">
            <p>A database with decentralized file storage clusters and a centralized cluster manager based on the
Chord protocol. The goal was to dynamically add and remove clusters, allowing data migration
between clusters by determining the predecessors and succesors using a consistent hashing method.
Versioning was incremented based on differences of hashes of 4096-bit blocks of files (deleted files
are marked as empty, but as an additional version); the database always assumed that if both the
client and server's representation of the file changed, the server was correct to maintain consistent
versioning between different clients. Servers and clients were coded in Go to ensure ease of
concurrent connections.The final product was used and tested across multiple AWS EC2 instances in
differnet regions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed client and server in <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a> to foster concurrent connections.</li>
<li>Utilized the Chord protocol for a distributed database over many file storage clusters to provide
redundancy in case of network failures.</li>
<li>Leveraged AWS EC2 instances for deployment of the servers and clusters.</li>

<h5>Short Summary:</h5>
<p>This portfolio website was created to maintain a list of projects, contact
information, and my resume. Entirely written in native HTML, JS, and CSS. The
only external libraries used and deployed are a dialog polyfill from the Google
Chrome team and Lit Elements for web component hydration. I do also use the Vite
to bundle my JavaScript files and Eleventy to statically generate the site. The
icons within the webpage are taken from Bootstrap v1.8.1.</p>
<h5>Action Points:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Developed a website to host an online portfolio of past and current projects
for career development</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> to statically generate the website and
increase modularity of website development</li>
<li>Leveraged <a href="https://lit.dev/">LitElement</a> and <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> to
support partial rehydration of web components and bundle JavaScript for page
load optimization</li>
</ul>
<h5>Notable things about this project:</h5>
<dl>
  <dt>Web Components:</dt>
  <dd>
    At first I used native web components but ran into many issues such as the
    fallback content in the description modal being rendered if modules were not
    supported. I ended up having to refactor the web components to only display
    the preview as fallback content and began to use Lit Element in order to
    support hydration and gradually upgrade the web components. This helped to
    keep the components modular.
  </dd>
  <dt>Static Site Generation:</dt>
  <dd>
    At first, I just wrote plain HTML without any developer tools which was not
    good for maintainability. I ended up using Eleventy in order to make each
    project more modular and keep them separate from the main HTML file. Overall,
    I enjoyed the experience of using it and think it's a really neat tool. I do
    plan on making the entire website more modular, but baby steps.
  </dd>
  <dt>JavaScript Bundling:</dt>
  <dd>
    This was the first time I used a bundling tool and decided to use Vite
    because some benchmarks showed that it delivered smaller resources. Getting
    it to work with Eleventy was a bit ifficky but allowed me to use Lit Element
    so it was overall worth the pain.
  </dd>
  <dt>Dialog polyfill</dt>
  <dd>
    While creating this website, I learned that the dialog element I was taking
    advantage of was just recently added to Firefox 98. In order to support
    older versions of Firefox browsers, I decided to implement
    <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/dialog-polyfill">
        Google Chrome's dialog polyfill.

            <h4>Roleplay Roller Scraper</h4>
            <p>Start Date -- End Date: <strong>Apr. 2022 -- Present</strong></p>
<h5>Short Summary:</h5>
<p>Some asynchronous roleplay communities use traditional tabletop RPG mechanics
that would require the use of dice for some randomness. One community that I was
a part of had a website dedicated to these rolls, but the owner of the website
eventually became inactive and drifted away from the community. In order to
preserve these rolls, which were necessary for some recordkeeping, I made a web
scraper to save them into a CSV file using NodeJS to make and parse requests and
Node-API to link a csv builder to find out the next point.</p>
<h5>Action Points:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Created a web scraper to save online dice rolls performed by a longstanding
roleplay community</li>
<li>Increased performance of the web scraper by binding an existing C library as
a native addon for node.js</li>
<li>Scraped dice rolls into valid CSV files to migrate to database systems that
support importing via CSV</li>
<li>Reduced the total number of queries by separating queries by dice roll ID and
the relevant character</li>
</ul>
<h5>Notable things about this project:</h5>
<dl>
    <dt>Project structure management and git submodules</dt>
    <dd>
        This project taught me a lot about different ways to handle submodule
        directories. Eventually, I ended up doing a hybrid model where I had
        library code in the root directory in their own folders and a
        distributed directory structure for bespoken code due to the simplicity
        of the project.
    </dd>
    <dt>Creating Node.js Native Addons with Node-API/N-API</dt>
    <dd>
        The project originally was just going to be a wrapper for a CSV parser
        that would end up looking for the missing IDs within a list of files.
        However, I ended up deciding to create it into a full fledged web
        crawler. As such, I needed to port my already-written C code to NodeJS.
        Although it took a while to learn, I learned how to create native
        Node.js addons using Node-API.
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Makefiles, implicit variables and rules, and automatic dependency
        generation
    </dt>
    <dd>
        While creating the Makefile, the first thing I learned was implicit
        variables and rules where Makefiles can imply dependencies based off of
        the target (such as main.c creating main.o) and compilation rules. These
        include implicit variables and tags that could be set to use these
        implicit rules.  However, since I used a distributed directory
        structure, I had to write my own rules to compile to different
        directories. This led to me researching automatic dependency generation
        through some C preprocessor flags ultimately simplifying the Makefile
        structure instead of explicitly writing every dependency.
    </dd>
    <dt>Linking C object files and libraries</dt>
    <dd>
        While a minor part of the project, I learned how to link shared dynamic
        libraries and static libraries even in different directories.
    </dd>
    <dt>Making ANSI- and ISO C89/C90-compliant C code</dt>
    <dd>
        While I do end up using GNULib's argp library to create a main
        executable (mainly for testing), all other code is ANSI compliant. While
        writing this, I actually had the chance to learn the reasons for certain
        specifications of the C89/C90 standards and how to accomodate the strict
        standards.

            <h4>Distributed Database</h4>
            <p>Project Date: <strong>Nov. 2021</strong></p>
<h5>Short Summary:</h5>
<p>A database with decentralized file storage clusters and a centralized cluster
manager using consistent hashing. The goal was to dynamically add and remove
clusters, allowing data migration between clusters by determining the
predecessors and succesors using a consistent hashing method. Versioning was
incremented based on differences of hashes of 4096-bit blocks of files (deleted
files are marked as empty, but as an additional version); the database always
assumed that if both the client and server's representation of the file changed,
the server was correct to maintain consistent versioning between different
clients. Servers and clients were coded in Go to ensure ease of concurrent
connections. The final product was used and tested across multiple AWS EC2
instances in differnet regions.</p>
<h5>Action Points:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Created a distributed database to maintain concurrent versions across
several clients as a school project</li>
<li>Devised a protocol to scale storage space across multiple servers to increase
service resiliency</li>
<li>Used consistent hashing to manage server nodes to allow for addition or
removal of nodes without interruption of the service</li>
<li>Built client and server programs in Go to foster concurrent connections</li>
<li>Developed a centralized server that mediates clients' queries to learn the
information of the node that their data is on</li>

<h5>Short Summary:</h5>
<p>School project accomplished during a course on deep networks. The goal was to
see how different architectures and hyperparameters performed on a
classification problem using a subset of the Food-101 dataset. We used Pytorch
in order to perform CUDA-accelerated learning and to import a ResNet (Residual
network) and VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group Network) for fine-tuned training by
replacing the classification layer.</p>
<h5>Action Points:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Developed a deep learning model to classify images from the Food-101 dataset
in a team of three developers</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://pytorch.org/">Pytorch</a> to develop a deep learning architecture
to improve developer experience and accelerate learning</li>
<li>Leveraged ImageNet models to perform transfer learning to achieve a 66%
validation accuracy on the Food-101 dataset</li>
<li>Created a validation pipeline to automate hyperparameter testing over the
course of 24 hours</li>

<p>As someone who participates in a lot of forum roleplaying communities, it can be
a pain to track and manage a character's inventory. If characters are trading
amongst themselves, it can also be a pain for people who try and track which
character which items as well. I ended up creating this project as a sort of
experiment to see how I would try and solve this problem. Although it never saw
use because the community decided that requiring its use would make things
unnecessarily difficult for casual members, it still exists as a
proof-of-concept.</p>

##### Short Summary:
A project for the IEEE chapter at UCSD's quarterly project competition of Fall
2019. The goal of the competition was to create a product that would help
2020. students with school with a team of 4 or 5. The project's aim was to allow
2021. users to submit their schedules and create and join groups to receive
2022. possible meeting times.

##### Action Points:
* Led a team of four developers to deliver a Java for Android app to coordinate
    schedules for meetings
* Created a PostgreSQL database for persistent user information including
    schedules and active groups
* Designed a RESTful API using [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/) to help
    users create groups and manage their schedules
* Developed a native Android app as a front-end to the scheduler service and API
* Used Heroku for our backend and Java for Android for the frontend of our app

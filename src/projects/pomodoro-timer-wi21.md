This was originally created as an academic project in my Software Engineering
course. The ultimate goal of the course was to understand how to work in a team
while practicing Agile methodologies to deliver a product that met a mock
client's request and specifications. This project took eight weeks until its
completion.

##### Roles in the collaborative project:
* Co-managed a team of eight developers to design and developer a web app using
    native web technologies.
* Deployed CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to perform E2E testing with
    [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
* Identified and developed necessary and quality of life features such as a
    tasklist and audible timer.
* Created tickets and reviewed other's pull requests to implement planned
    features.
* Participated in daily standup meetings with teammates and weekly meetings with
    with the mock client.

##### Short Summary:
This was originally created as an academic project in my Software Engineering
course. The ultimate goal of the course was to understand how to work in a team
while practicing Agile methodologies to deliver a product that met a mock
client's request and specifications. This project took eight weeks until its
completion.

##### Action Points:
* Managed a team of eight developers to design and develop a web app from
    scratch native web technologies
* Ensured adherence to agreed quality standards by performing code reviews and
    regulating team practice
* Participated in regular meetings with a mock stakeholder to continuously
    receive feedback on the app
* Created a test suite in the CI pipeline using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for
    unit/integration testing and [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for E2E testing

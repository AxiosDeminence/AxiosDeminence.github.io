title: Roleplay Market Inventory Manager
brief_desc: PostgreSQL database and REST API using Django to help roleplayers manage inventories and transactions.
---
<p>
  As someone who participates in a lot of forum roleplaying communities, it can be a
  pain to track and manage a character's inventory. If characters are trading amongst
  themselves, it can also be a pain for people who try and track which character which
  items as well. I ended up creating this project as a sort of experiment to see how I
  would try and solve this problem. Although it never saw use because the community
  decided that requiring its use would make things unnecessarily difficult for casual
  members, it still exists as a proof-of-concept.
